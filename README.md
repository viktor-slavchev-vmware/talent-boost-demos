# Talent boost demos 2023
The purpose of this repo is to showcase testing tools we are using for the assignment for VMWare Talent boost 2023. 

Author and main contributor vslavchev(at)vmware.com

This is not an official VMWare product, just a POC of tools. 

**This is NOT production ready code, so please regard it with absolute scrutiny.**

Examples provided work with this repo in Github, if you want to execute the tests you will need valid access token. (Which I won't provide you with ;)
